## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up and use the Spellcast Solver on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- You have installed Python 3.x.
- You have a Windows, macOS, or Linux machine.

### Installation

#### Windows

1. Download the Python code file from the repository.
2. Open a command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the code file.
3. Install any required dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### macOS

1. Download the Python code file from the repository.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing the code file.
3. Install any required dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Linux

1. Download the Python code file from the repository.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing the code file.
3. Install any required dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

After installing the required dependencies, you can use the Spellcast Solver as follows:

```bash
python spellcast_solver.py
```

The script will prompt you to enter the grid of letters and the special character index (ZERO INDEX BASED! SUBTRACT 1 FROM THE CHARACTER'S POSITION). It will then generate the highest-scoring word based on the given input.

If the word is not recognized by spellcast, simply continue with generating words by entering "y" and it will generate the next best word.
